## Structure Overview

### I. Introduction (Paragraphs 1-4)
- **Personal Anecdote**: 
  - Author faces social judgment for correcting son's English
  - Former student's travel experience reveals communication limitations

### II. Body (Paragraphs 5-12)
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Root Causes:
     - Systemic failure in language education
     - Prevalence of incorrect daily language patterns
   - Consequences:
     - Students face unfair criticism despite knowledge gaps

2. **Institutional Accountability**:
   - Schools' shortcomings:
     - Lack of rigorous standards
     - Insufficient grammar instruction
     - Limited vocabulary development

3. **Interactive Teaching Demonstration**:
   - Real-world pedagogy:
     - Car ride teaching moment
     - Progressive grammar instruction:
       1. Initial error correction ("ate" vs "eated")
       2. Introduction to parts of speech
